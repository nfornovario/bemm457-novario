**Consumer Spending Forecasting Project**

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for a project focused on forecasting consumer spending in the UK using advanced time series and machine learning techniques. The project explores spending trends across multiple categories and examines the impact of external factors such as inflation (PPI) and public holidays on expenditure.

**Features**
- Data Preprocessing: Scripts for cleaning and merging datasets, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- Feature Engineering: Lagged features and rolling averages created to enhance predictive accuracy.
- Models:
    - SARIMAX: Incorporates seasonality and exogenous variables for traditional time series forecasting.
    - XGBoost: Captures non-linear interactions and complements SARIMAX for enhanced prediction.
- Evaluation: Metrics such as MAE and RMSE used to assess model performance.
- Visualisation: Clear and informative plots to compare actual vs. predicted spending and feature importance.
